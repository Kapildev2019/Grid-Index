about=This plugin creates a highly customizable grid of rectangular polygons for map book and atlas page indexing.

Key Features:
*   Generates a grid over the full extent of an Intersection Layer.
*   Supports vector (point, line, polygon) and raster layers for intersection.
*   Intelligently handles Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS):
    *   For projected layers, allows specifying cell size in any supported distance unit (meters, feet, etc.).
    *   For geographic layers (e.g., WGS 84), it automatically determines the best projected CRS for calculation to avoid distortion, while treating your input as meters.
*   Advanced labeling and numbering controls:
    *   Choose which corner of the grid to start labeling from (Top-Left, Top-Right, etc.). This affects both the sequential PageNumber and the PageName.
    *   Option to use absolute grid positions for names (e.g., C5 is always in the 5th column) or sequential names within each row.
*   Create custom-sized grids or override dimensions by specifying the number of rows and columns.

changelog=
Version 1.0 (2024-xx-xx):
- Complete overhaul of the tool's logic and user interface.
- Added support for both projected and geographic (WGS 84) coordinate systems with automatic reprojection.
- Added support for raster layers as an intersection layer.
- Added advanced options for choosing the labeling start corner (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).
- Added advanced option for using absolute or sequential grid naming.
- Simplified UI by removing the manual extent parameter; the grid is now always based on the intersection layer's extent.
