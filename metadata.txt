about=This plugin creates a highly customizable grid of rectangular polygons for map book and atlas page indexing. Supports vector (point, line, polygon). Advanced labeling and numbering controls: Choose which corner of the grid to start labeling from (Top-Left, Top-Right, etc.). This affects both the sequential PageNumber and the PageName. Option to use absolute grid positions for names (e.g., C5 is always in the 5th column) or sequential names within each row. Create custom-sized grids or override dimensions by specifying the number of rows and columns.
